# KnowledgeUI
Application to Interact with a Knowledge Base in a Triple Store

# How to run the project
1) Clone it: git clone < link to the repo >
2) open the directory where you cloned it.
3) Good practice but not mandatory: Create a virtualenvironnement in it *1
4) pip install -r requirements.txt
5) repeat with all the requiremetns files :p
5) open the file .env
6) uncomment the last line. Just get rid of the # in front of the DATASET_LINK
    if you want to connect to an other dataset replace the link
7) python run.py

*1) Please use virtualenv and not things like anaconda. Respect your computer
